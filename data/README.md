# Real data

This folder contains the real annex C overlays, i.e. own forces' plan of actions, as digitized and stored. This is the raw data.

The digital images aquired from the films are divided into two groups - benchmark set contains higher clarity images, more up to the actual military standard.
The development set has more messy plans, with clutter or oddly shaped symbols.

In the scirpts in other folders, the development set data was further divided into training and validation data, was labeled, labeled symbols were extracted from the training set images etc. You can find these processing results in the generator/data folder. This folder here only contains the raw data.
